The tasks are the following:
- Part 1 is a simulation of the blockchain functionality using Postgres database.
- Part 2 is about the RSA encryption algorithm. We show in the first exercise an implementation from scratch of retrieving of parameters (n, e and d) from p and q (prime numbers). In the second exercise, we implement an encryption/decryption mechanism using the outcomes of the first exercies.
Part 3 we the site https://bitcoindev.network/bitcoin-cli-sandbox/ for interacting with regtest mode of blockahin (a version that runs locally). We provide screenshots of the transactions including creating a block, sending a transaction, etc.
